react component always is imported into the layout that has navbar and the challenge title.Hence no
need to add title or navbar.

The default styles are present in
/Users/spai3/Documents/sadanand/projects/frontend-mini-challenges/shared/styles that include sr-only

As the styles reset are already present in the cores styles, no need to add styles of box-sizing
etc. There is no need to handle light and dark mode for any challenges.

Scope of the changes should be only within apps/react/src
